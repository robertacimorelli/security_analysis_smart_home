You can download VAC tool here: https://www.southampton.ac.uk/~gp1y10/VAC.html <br />
In the policy file you can find our case study for a smart home environment. <br />
To repeat the results of the experiments you can use the policyVACquery files.<br />

policyVACquery1 file tests if a kid is able to access the adult controlled devices; <br />
policyVACquery2 file checks whether a guest can control the owner's devices; <br />
policyVACquery3 file checks if the babysitter who comes on Wednesday can have access to the clock device. <br />
policyVACquery4 file tests whether the maid can use cleaning devices if she does not have access to the room to be cleaned. <br />
policyVACquery5-1 checks whether a babysitter can have access to the childâ€™s smart toy (contained in the KidsFriendlyContent device role) while in policyVACquery5-2 we control if a guest can have access to it.
